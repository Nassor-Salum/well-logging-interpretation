# üõ¢Ô∏è Well Logging Interpretation ‚Äì Shale Volume, Stability & Hydrocarbon Analysis

This project focuses on the interpretation of well log data using Microsoft Excel to identify production zones, estimate shale volume, detect hydrocarbon presence, and classify lithology.

## üìå Key Objectives

- Analyze provided well log data in Excel
- Estimate shale volume using multiple empirical models
- Identify hydrocarbon-bearing zones through crossplots
- Evaluate wellbore stability using caliper and bit size logs
- Classify lithologies using Density and PEF logs

## üîç Main Contributions

### ‚úÖ Shale Volume Estimation
Calculated and compared shale volume using:
- **Steiber model**
- **Clavier model**
- **Larionov model**

These were visualized together in one comparative chart.

### ‚úÖ Wellbore Stability Analysis
Plotted caliper log vs. bit size to evaluate borehole washouts and tight spots.

### ‚úÖ Hydrocarbon Detection
Crossplot between Neutron and Density logs to identify oil and gas indicators.

### ‚úÖ Lithology Classification
Analyzed Density and Photoelectric Effect (PEF) logs to distinguish sandstone, dolomite, and other lithologies.
